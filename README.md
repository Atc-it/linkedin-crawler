Usage

To start using this application, you will need to install the following:

* `phantomjs`
* `meteor`
* `npm`
* `meteor-npm`

After installation of these packages, you can execute `make -j 2` to run the application and `make clean` to delete all database files for fresh runs. On Mac, you may need to run `make setup` before you can run the application to install npm dependencies.
